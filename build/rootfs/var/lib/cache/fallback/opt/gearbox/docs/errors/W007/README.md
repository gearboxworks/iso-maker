# W007 - Warning project not supported.

## Cause
Usually a critical error returned from the `box` command with any of the sub-commands `install`, `ls`, `start`, `stop`, `rm`, `clean` and `refresh`.
The 'gearbox' project definition was changed within the `container` script.

## Common fixes
Consult GearBox support.
